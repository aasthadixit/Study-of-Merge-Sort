# Study-of-Merge-Sort
This project is a techical study of Merge Sort vs Priority Queues for several inputs. This project was part of my academics.

The Source folder has 4 .java files
The Driver_PriorityQueue.java is the starter class for running a Priority Queue program.
The Driver_MergeSort.java is the started class for running a Merge Sort program.
The input n can be given inside the above two files for testing purpose.
The excel sheet contains the captured running time values for both the algorithms.
